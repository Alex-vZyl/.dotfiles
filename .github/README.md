The configuration files for my NixOS Linux desktop.

> [!WARNING]
> The NixOS setup is still under heavy development.

> [!NOTE]
> The old Arch Linux dotfiles can be found on the [archlinux branch](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/tree/archlinux).

# Full Installation

To install everything, simply copy and paste this into the terminal.  User input is requested at various stages.

> [!NOTE]
> This script assumes that you have a working Arch X11/i3 installation.  Remember to choose i3 at the login screen.

> [!WARNING]
> Works on my machine.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/main/.scripts/install/bootstrap.sh > ~/bootstrap.sh
chmod +x ~/bootstrap.sh && ~/bootstrap.sh && rm ~/bootstrap.sh
reboot
```

<!--
# Minimal Installation

Sometimes I just want to get work done on a Linux machine.  A minimal installation can be done with:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/main/.scripts/install/minimal_workspace.sh > ~/bootstrap.sh
chmod +x ~/bootstrap.sh && ~/bootstrap.sh && rm ~/bootstrap.sh
```
And to update:
```bash
workspace-git fetch
workspace-git pull
```

# Privacy and Security

Although I like making it look as nice as possible, these dotfiles also try to be private and secure.  This is a journey, not a destination, and I am open to any input.

<details>

<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Measures</summary>

</br>

- [Scripts](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/tree/main/.scripts/security) I sometimes use.
- Manually keeping system up to date (`yay -Syyu`)
- Malware scanning and database updating ([clamav](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav))
- Firewall ([ufw](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Uncomplicated_Firewall))
- Ban IPs ([fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban))
- Using [Signal](https://github.com/signalapp) (when possible)
- Hosting API keys in a private repo
- Hardened firefox ([user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/))
- I could install the hardened Linux kernel, but that might be slightly pedantic...
- Port scanning ([nmap](https://github.com/nmap/nmap), [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan))

# Theme

Personally, I want a balance between good looking colors that stand out, and soft colors that will not destroy my eyes.

> [!NOTE]
> Not using nordic at the moment.

The theme is based on my Neovim plugin, [nordic.nvim](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nordic.nvim).  It is a warmer and darker version of the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) color palette.  Wallpapers can be found at [this ImageGoNord repo](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers) (they "norded" some nice wallpapers) and [locally](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/tree/main/.wallpapers).

# Showcase

Some screenshots showing off the desktop and rice, as well as some custom features I wrote.  Everything has to be *just right*.  I am spending 8+ hours a day on this working, so it might as well be a nice experience.

# Key Bindings

A few notes on the bindings:

- Keys combined with the `Super` key are reserved for OS and WM related actions.  
- Arrows and `hjkl` keys are interchangeable.
